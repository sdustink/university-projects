# ðŸŽ“ university-projects
This repository highlights the projects and assignments I completed during my Computer Science degree, majoring in Data Science at my university. It includes both individual projects and group collaborations, most of which were done for final exam projects or end-of-semester showcases. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my learning journey and the academic foundations I have built across different areas of computer science and data science.
